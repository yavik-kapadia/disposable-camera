# ðŸš€ Quick E2E Setup - 3 Easy Steps

## Prerequisites
âœ… **You're already signed in** to your app (you have valid tokens!)  
âœ… **Session injection** is configured

## Two Options

### Option A: Use Tokens You Already Have (FASTEST - 2 minutes)

Since you already provided your access token, let's just add the refresh token manually:

#### Step 1: Get Refresh Token (30 seconds)
1. Open your app in Chrome (http://localhost:3000)
2. Press **F12** â†’ **Console** tab
3. Paste:
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sb-uhvfrypgsrhgawvedguc-auth-token')).refresh_token
```
4. Copy the token (starts with `v2.public.` or similar)

#### Step 2: Update .env.e2e (30 seconds)
Edit `e2e/.env.e2e` and replace:
```env
E2E_REFRESH_TOKEN='REPLACE_WITH_REFRESH_TOKEN'
```
with your actual token

#### Step 3: Run Setup (1 minute)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:setup
npm run test:e2e
```

**Done!** âœ…

### Option B: Fully Automated Extraction (4 minutes)

Use the automated script (requires dev server running):

#### Step 1: Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Step 2: Sign In
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and sign in with Google

#### Step 3: Extract Tokens (in a new terminal)
```bash
npm run extract-tokens
```

#### Step 4: Run Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e:setup
npm run test:e2e
```

**Done!** âœ…

## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Option A if:
- âœ… You want the fastest setup (2 min)
- âœ… You're already signed in
- âœ… You don't mind one copy-paste

### Choose Option B if:
- âœ… You want zero copy-paste
- âœ… Dev server is already running
- âœ… You prefer full automation

## My Recommendation

**Use Option A** - It's faster since you already have the access token. Just need the refresh token!

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" error
â†’ Dev server not running. Start it: `npm run dev`

### "No session found"
â†’ Not signed in. Go to http://localhost:3000 and sign in with Google

### "Tokens expired"
â†’ Run `npm run extract-tokens` again to get fresh tokens

---

## What Happens After Setup?

Once tokens are configured:
1. âœ… Session injection setup runs: `npm run test:e2e:setup`
2. âœ… Tokens get injected into browser
3. âœ… All tests run as authenticated user
4. âœ… No Google OAuth blocking!
5. âœ… Tests work for 60 days!

Then you can run tests anytime:
```bash
npm run test:e2e          # All tests
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Interactive
npm run test:e2e:auth     # Only authenticated
```

**No re-authentication needed for 60 days!** ðŸŽ‰
