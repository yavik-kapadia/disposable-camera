## 🎨 Creating App Icons

You need to create the following icon files in the `/public` directory:

### Required Icons:

1. **icon-192.png** (192×192px)
   - Used for Android and small screens
   
2. **icon-512.png** (512×512px)
   - Used for Android and large screens
   
3. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180×180px)
   - Used for iOS home screen icon
   - Should have no transparency (solid background)

### Icon Design Tips:
- 📸 Use a camera icon with orange (#f97316) accent
- ⬛ Add padding around the icon (safe area)
- 🎨 For iOS: solid background (no transparency)
- 🤖 For Android: can use transparency

### Quick Icon Generation:

You can use tools like:
- **Figma** - Design and export at multiple sizes
- **favicon.io** - Generate from text/image
- **PWA Asset Generator** - `npx pwa-asset-generator`

Example command:
```bash
npx pwa-asset-generator camera-logo.svg ./public --icon-only
```

## 📱 Testing Your PWA

### On iPhone:
1. Open Safari
2. Go to your deployed URL (HTTPS required!)
3. Look for "Add to Home Screen" option
4. Add it and launch from home screen

### On Android:
1. Open Chrome
2. Look for "Install" prompt at bottom
3. Or use menu → "Add to Home Screen"

### Desktop:

## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

### HTTPS Required
PWAs **must** be served over HTTPS (except localhost for testing)
