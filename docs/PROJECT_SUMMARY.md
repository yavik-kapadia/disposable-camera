## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Components)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (S3-compatible)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime
- **QR Codes**: qrcode library
- **File Handling**: JSZip for bulk downloads
- **Image Processing**: Canvas API for compression

## Database Schema

### Tables

**events**
- Stores event information
- Unique access codes for guest access
- Active/inactive status for event control
- Optional expiration dates

**images**
- Photo metadata and file references
- Links to events via foreign key
- Optional guest names and captions
- JSONB metadata for extensibility

### Storage

**event-images bucket**
- Public bucket for fast image delivery
- Organized by event ID folders
- Automatic file path generation
- Policies for read/write access

## User Flows

### Event Creator Flow
1. Visit home page
2. Fill in event details (name, description, etc.)
3. Click "Create Event"
4. Get redirected to dashboard with QR code
5. Share QR code or access code with guests
6. Watch photos arrive in real-time
7. Download all photos as ZIP
8. Close event when done

### Guest Flow
1. Scan QR code or enter access code
2. Grant camera permissions
3. **Option A - Camera**: Take photos, they auto-upload and save
4. **Option B - Upload**: Select photos from gallery and upload
5. See confirmation of uploads
6. Continue uploading more photos

## Key Implementation Details

### Camera Capture
- Uses `getUserMedia` API for camera access
- Supports front/back camera switching
- Canvas-based image capture
- Automatic JPEG compression
- Visual flash effect on capture
- Downloads to device simultaneously

### Image Upload
- Multiple file selection
- Progress tracking
- Individual file compression
- Batch upload with status updates
- Guest name attribution

### Real-time Updates
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- Listens for INSERT events on images table
- Updates UI without page refresh
- Shows new photos instantly

### QR Code
- Generates URL to camera page with access code
- Downloadable as PNG
- Properly sized for mobile scanning
- High error correction

### Bulk Download
- Fetches all event images from storage
- Creates ZIP archive client-side
- Names files with original names
- Folder named after event

## Security Considerations

### What's Protected
- Row Level Security on all tables
- Storage bucket policies
- Access code-based privacy
- Event active status checks

### What's Not Included (Future Enhancements)
- User authentication (intentionally simple)
- Rate limiting (Supabase has some built-in)
- Image moderation
- EXIF data stripping
- Watermarking

## Performance Optimizations

- Image compression before upload (reduces size 60-80%)
- Lazy loading for image gallery
- Real-time updates instead of polling
- Public bucket for CDN delivery
- Static page generation where possible

## Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Safari (iOS 14.3+, macOS)
- Firefox (latest)

### Camera Feature Requirements
- HTTPS (required for camera API)
- Camera permissions granted
- Modern browser with getUserMedia support

## Deployment Recommendations

### Recommended Platforms
- **Vercel**: Best for Next.js (one-click deploy)
- **Netlify**: Also great, good free tier
- **Railway**: If you want more control

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Post-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Update CORS settings in Supabase
- [ ] Test camera on HTTPS
- [ ] Test QR code scanning
- [ ] Verify image uploads work
- [ ] Test bulk download
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness

## Future Enhancement Ideas

### Priority 1 (High Value)
- [ ] Image thumbnails for faster gallery loading
- [ ] Event password protection
- [ ] Photo captions from guests
- [ ] Download individual photos
- [ ] Photo count per event

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Event creator authentication
- [ ] Multiple events per creator
- [ ] Photo reactions/likes
- [ ] Event analytics (views, uploads, etc.)
- [ ] Custom QR code styling
- [ ] Event themes/branding

### Priority 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] Photo filters/effects
- [ ] Video support
- [ ] Live photo stream display
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Social media sharing
- [ ] AI image moderation
- [ ] Photo albums/collections

## Known Limitations

1. **No Authentication**: Keeps it simple but limits features
2. **Public Storage**: Anyone with URL can view images
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Could be abused without Supabase limits
4. **Client-side Compression**: Large images may take time
5. **ZIP Generation**: Memory-intensive for large events
6. **No Image Editing**: Photos uploaded as-is
