### Configuration Updates
```
✅ playwright.config.ts  - Auth setup integration
✅ .gitignore            - Excludes credentials
✅ package.json          - 6 new test scripts
```

## 🚀 What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Add Your Test Credentials

You mentioned you have a test Google account. Let's add those credentials:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp e2e/.env.e2e.example e2e/.env.e2e

# Edit and add your credentials
nano e2e/.env.e2e
```

Add these lines:
```env
TEST_USER_EMAIL=your-test-email@gmail.com
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=your-test-password
```

**Important**: Replace with your actual test account credentials!

### Step 2: Test Authentication

Run the auth setup in headed mode (you'll see the browser):

```bash
npm run test:e2e:setup
```

Watch it:
1. Open browser
2. Navigate to your app
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Fill in credentials
5. Complete OAuth
6. Save session

If successful, you'll see:
```
✅ Authentication successful!
💾 Saved authentication state to: playwright/.auth/user.json
```

### Step 3: Run All E2E Tests

Once authentication works:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Or use interactive UI mode (recommended)
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## 📋 Quick Command Reference

```bash
# === First Time Setup ===
cp e2e/.env.e2e.example e2e/.env.e2e  # Copy template
nano e2e/.env.e2e                      # Add credentials
npm run test:e2e:setup                 # Test auth (watch it work)

# === Run Tests ===
npm run test:e2e              # All E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui           # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:auth         # Only authenticated tests
npm run test:e2e:public       # Only public tests
npm run test:e2e:headed       # See the browser

# === Debugging ===
npm run test:e2e:setup        # Re-run auth setup
npx playwright test --debug   # Step through tests
npx playwright show-report    # View last results

# === Specific Tests ===
npx playwright test dashboard-authenticated  # Just dashboard
npx playwright test event-workflow           # Just workflows
npx playwright test --project=chromium       # One browser
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

```
Unit Tests:       71 tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
Public E2E:       30 tests (no auth needed)
Authenticated:    75 tests (with real Google login)
Setup:            1 test (authentication)
---
Total:           177 tests
Browsers:        5 (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile)
Total Runs:      ~530 test executions
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "TEST_USER_EMAIL and TEST_USER_PASSWORD must be set"
→ Create `e2e/.env.e2e` with your credentials

### Authentication fails or times out
→ Run with `--headed` to see what's happening:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:setup
```

### Google shows "This browser may not be secure"
→ Use a dedicated test account, or solve captcha once (session is saved)

### Tests are being skipped
→ Setup test failed. Check credentials and re-run auth setup

### Session expired
→ Delete and re-authenticate:
```bash
rm playwright/.auth/user.json
npm run test:e2e:setup
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ `.env.e2e` is git-ignored (safe)
- ✅ `.auth/` directory is git-ignored (safe)
- ✅ Only you will have the credentials file
- ⚠️ Never commit credentials to git
- ⚠️ Use a dedicated test account (not personal)
