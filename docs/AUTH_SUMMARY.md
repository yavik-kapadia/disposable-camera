# Authentication Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Google OAuth authentication has been added to the Disposable Camera app. Here's what changed:

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**File**: `supabase/schema.sql`
- Added `creator_id` column to `events` table (references `auth.users`)
- Updated RLS policies:
  - Only authenticated users can create events
  - Only event creators can update their own events
  - Guests can still join events and upload photos without auth

**Migration File**: `supabase/migration_add_auth.sql`
- For existing databases, run this migration to add authentication support

### 2. Authentication Context

**File**: `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (NEW)
- React context for managing authentication state
- Provides:
  - `user`: Current authenticated user
  - `session`: Current session
  - `loading`: Auth loading state
  - `signInWithGoogle()`: Sign in with Google OAuth
  - `signOut()`: Sign out function

### 3. Auth Callback Route

**File**: `app/auth/callback/route.ts` (NEW)
- Handles OAuth callback from Google
- Exchanges code for session
- Redirects back to home page

### 4. Updated Components

**File**: `app/layout.tsx`
- Wrapped app with `AuthProvider`
- All pages now have access to auth context

**File**: `app/page.tsx`
- Shows "Sign in with Google" button when not authenticated
- Shows event creation form when authenticated
- Displays user email and sign out button
- Join Event section remains accessible to all (no auth required)

### 5. Documentation

**File**: `docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` (NEW)
- Complete step-by-step guide for:
  - Creating Google OAuth credentials
  - Configuring Supabase
  - Running database migrations
  - Testing the flow
  - Production deployment

## User Flow

### Event Creators (Authenticated)

1. Visit home page
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Authorize with Google account
4. Create events (linked to their account)
5. Access event dashboard to manage photos
6. Only they can update their own events

### Event Guests (No Auth Required)

1. Visit home page or scan QR code
2. Enter access code
3. Upload photos without signing in
4. Photos are linked to the event

## Next Steps

### To Complete Setup:

1. **Follow Google OAuth Setup Guide**:
   - See `docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`
   - Create Google OAuth credentials
   - Configure in Supabase dashboard

2. **Run Database Migration** (if existing database):
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   -- Copy/paste from supabase/migration_add_auth.sql
   ```

3. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Try signing in with Google
   - Create a test event
   - Verify guest access still works

### Optional Enhancements:

- Add user profile management
- Show user's events list
- Add event sharing/collaboration features
- Implement event expiration
- Add email notifications

## Files Changed

- `supabase/schema.sql` - Updated schema with auth
- `supabase/migration_add_auth.sql` - NEW migration file
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - NEW auth context
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - NEW OAuth callback
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added AuthProvider
- `app/page.tsx` - Added sign in/out UI
- `docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` - NEW setup guide
- `docs/AUTH_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Important Notes

- Guests DO NOT need to sign in to join events or upload photos
- Only event creation requires authentication
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Google OAuth is the only sign-in method (as requested)
